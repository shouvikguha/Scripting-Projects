# Scripting Projects

Developed a suite of Bash scripts, with a focus on enhancing scripting abilities and problem-solving skills. 

    - Built a script for output comparison, significantly increasing efficiency in validating program correctness.
    - Crafted a parallelogram printer, demonstrating competence in data manipulation and visualization via scripting.
    - Architected an e-library solution, incorporating elements/titles from the Gutenberg project downloads, performing 
      character frequency analysis, handling exceptions, and ensuring optimal file management

Project 1 is a script designed to automate the comparison of two programs, possibly for testing or grading purposes. Utilizing various functions, it verifies permissions, manages temporary files, and compares the output of the programs using standard tools like diff, handling different input methods and providing detailed feedback on the results.

Project 2 is a Bash script designed to print parallelogram patterns based on user input, with each pattern consisting of four connected triangles made of stars and spaces. The user is prompted to enter the size of the parallelograms, and the script checks the input for validity within a defined range, printing the pattern if valid and offering an option to run the pattern again.

Project 3 involves creating a bash script to manage a library of books, allowing the user to select from a list of titles, download the books if necessary, and analyze them. Specifically, the script includes functionality to check and create a library directory, download books, print available titles, check for book existence, and count the occurrences of each ASCII character within the selected book, up to a specific number of lines.
